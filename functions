#functions restart 

# the function starts with a header
# the def function is at the beginning to define that 
# this is a function
# the def function is followed by function definition and 
# ends with a colon
#rules for functon names are those of variables

# eg 
def hello_world():
    print(hello_world)

# return is used to print output 
# return is confused with print 
# the diffs is that print gives output to the console
# but return provides a value u can work with later in code


def cylinder_volume(height, radius):
    pi = 3.14

    return volume

# when defining a function use descriptive words that u can understand 
# the work of the function 
# eg area_square, cylinder_volume
