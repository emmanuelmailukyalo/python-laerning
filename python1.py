    # + Addition
    # - Subtraction
    # * Multiplication
    # / Division
    # % Mod (the remainder after dividing)

    # // Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer

# variables
    # Only use ordinary letters, numbers and underscores in your variable names. They can’t have spaces, and need to start with a letter or underscore.
    # You can’t use reserved words or built-in identifiers
    # use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words 

   mv_population=6000
    # 400 moved away out of mv 
    mv_population=6000-400
    print(mv_population)

    # this statement will lead to an error because this is not 
    # html and css.

    # for this statement to work you must assign an assignment operator
    # to display it new value. 

    # like so 
    mv_population= 7000
    mv_population= mv_population + 6000-400
    print(mv_population)

    # this will work 
    # but there is a better and easier way using assignment operators 
    # instead of reapeting mv_population again use an assignment operator 
    # += which shows we r increasing the variable in the left with the right 

    # eg
    mv_population= 7000
    mv_population += 6000-400
    print(mv_population)
